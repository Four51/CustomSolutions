 2. Go to the Four51 Storefront 2.0 tab
 3. If a custom Product Detail Template is assigned to the product, modify that template
    with the ProductZoom code (step 4. below), otherwise create new
    Product Detail Template. You can name the new template whatever is
    appropriate for you.
 4. On your new Product Detail Template, replace this section:

```html
    <img id="451_img_prod_lg" class="product-image-large img-responsive" ng-src="{{LineItem.Variant.PreviewUrl || LineItem.Variant.LargeImageUrl || LineItem.Product.LargeImageUrl}}" imageonload />
```

with the following:

```html
    <productzoom lineitem="LineItem" kit="Kit.KitParent"></productzoom>
```

###3. Apply Product Detail Template to product(s)

Using Product Properties, assign your new/updated Product Detail Template to any products requiring the Product Zoom feature

##Additional Information

 * All ProductZoom products need to have an image loaded for both the Large image and the Thumbnail image. The Large image must be a larger size from the Thumbnail image since it enables the zoom. Please see the Image Recommendations below. 
 * If you would like other style customizations, you can do this with CSS.  The default values are listed below. 
```css
 .jetzoom-lens {
	 1. border: none;
	 2. width: 80%;
	 3. height: 80%;
	 4. border-radius: 20px;
	 5. box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0,0,0,.4);
	 6. cursor: none;
}
```

#### Image Recommendations
#####Thumbnail
* minimum of 300w x 300h, cropped to top, no white space (1)
* All images should retain the same aspect ratio and height (2)
* Minimum of 72dpi
* If a product has multiple sides, use the cover image only for the thumbnail

#####Large Image for Product Zoom
* Minimum of 1000w, cropped to top, no white space
* Minimum of 72dpi

>**Notes**
* (1) white space can be added via css and shouldn't be added to the image for consistency. 
* (2) maintaining a consistent height and width for the thumbnail (i.e. category, product list views) is preferable to avoid additional css considerations.
