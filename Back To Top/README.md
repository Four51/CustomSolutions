# Back to Top for Four51 Storefront

This module provides the user with the ability to add a dynamically appearing arrow button to the bottom right of the page that will return them to the top of the page when clicked.

## Setup
### 1. Add module file to your project.
Add the **`backToTop.js`** file to your project.

If you are using a repository, add this file to the **`/lib/oc`** directory.

If you are using file overrides, create a new file override named **`lib/oc/backToTop.js`** and add this file as the content by following these steps:

 1. Edit your 2.0 site
 2. Go to “Code Editor” tab
 3. Click “New File Override”
 4. Name this file **`lib/oc/backToTop.js`**
 5. Place raw code from **`backToTop.js`**  in the section below. Save.

**Important!** Be sure to reference the new/updated JS file in the **`index.html`** file by following these steps:

 1. In Code Editor, locate your index.html file, hit edit. 
 2. Add `<script src="lib/oc/backToTop.js" data-group="resources"></script>` in the section with “lib/oc” files. Save

### 2. Load the module into the application.
Add a dependency for `OrderCloud-BackToTop` to the Four51.app module in the **`js/app.js`** file by following these steps. 

 1. In Code Editor, locate your **`js/app.js`** file, hit edit. 
 2. Add **‘OrderCloud-BackToTop’** into the file. Save.


## Usage
### 1. Add the directive to the index.html file

Place this tag in the **`index.html`** file: 
```html
    <backtotop offsetbottom="30" offsetright="30" duration="200"></backtotop>
```
>**Note:** We recommend adding the directive to the index file underneath the last ending `</section>` tag so that the button is available on each page.

Below is a list of what the directive attributes mean in case you would like to customize formatting. 

 - offsetbottom: number of pixels the button will appear from the bottom
 - offsetright: number of pixels the button will appear from the right
 - duration: amount of time the directive will take to reach the top
